## Introduction

This is a replication package for the paper "Challenges and Strategies during Software Development Tool Installation".

## Folder explanation

The folder "Transcripts" contain the transcripts extracted from the 18 think-aloud sessions. In the transcripts, we highlighted the *challenges* using the colour *pink*, and the *strategies* using the colour *green*. The screenshots of the participants during installation process are included in the transcripts as well. We further anonymise the participants' identity by occluding it with a stripe.
